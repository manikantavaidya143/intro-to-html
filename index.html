Vaishnavism and Shaivism are symbolised by Lord Ayyappa who helps to propagate the edicts of both the sects.<p/>
<h1>Origin Of Sabarimala Temple</h1>

<p>The origin of the temple is debatable and not much known and various experts have their own theories about the establishment of the temple. Since ancient times in south India sastha worship was prevalent and it is believed that the Avatar of Lord Ayyappa was the prince of the Pandalam dynasty who visited here to meditate. This site is known as Manimandapam.
  The Sabarimala temple was founded by Lord Parshuram and it is one of the five sastha temples founded by him. During ancient times it was very difficult to reach the temple because of geographical reasons but king Rajasekhra Pandian found the real path to the temple in the 12th century AD. The modern-day idol of Lord Ayyappa was placed in 1910.</p>
